# react-memory-card

In this project, I will be putting my knowledge to the test on some of the React concepts that I have learnt up to date:

- How to deal with side effects in react using the useEffect hook (retrieving data from PokeAPI)
- How to cache expensive computations 
- When not to use effects, whilst utilizing states only
